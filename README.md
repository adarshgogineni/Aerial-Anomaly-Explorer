# Aerial Anomaly Explorer
 web application that visualizes UAP sighting reports on an interactive map and uses machine learning to highlight spatiotemporal anomalies and narrative patterns in the data. All heavy ML work is done offline; the deployed app reads precomputed JSON “tiles” and metadata, so it feels fast and responsive while remaining simple to host (static/serverless).
